**Analysis and Visualization of  Bike-Sharing Data with Tableau**

  ## Overview of Project
  A stakeholder would like to see an analysis of the New York CikiBike sharing program and leverage on the result of this analysis to convince investors that a similar bike-sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa will be successful. In this project, we will analyze data from New York CikiBike sharing data for the month of August 2019 and prepare visualizations that will be helpful for the stakeholder to make this business decision.  

   The sequence of analysis to be followed for this project is summarized below:

  1.	Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format using Python.
  2.	Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis using Tableau Public
  3.	Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation using Tableau Public


  ## Results
  
  ### Link to Tableau Dashboard
  The tableau dashboard for this project can be accessed using the following link: [NYC_CitiBike_Challenge](https://public.tableau.com/views/NYC_Citibike_Challenge_16701465662600/NYCCitiBikeStory?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

  Our results will be discussed under the following headings:

   ### Checkout Times For Users

   The graph below shows a plot of the Number of Bikes against the Trip Duration. From this plot, it is observed that the peak bike usage occured within 5 minutes of the trip with a peak number of 146,752 bikes recorded during this period.

   ### Checkout Times by Gender

   The figure below shows a plot of the Number of Bikes recorded for each gender against the corresponding trip duration. It is evident that there are more male bike rides recorded during this period with a peak number of 108,087 bikes

   ### Trips by Weekday Per Hour

   Below is a heatmap of the trips recorded for each day of the week at different time intervals. From this plot, we can observe that the largest volume of bike trips occurs at 6pm on Thursdays.

   ### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)

   The heatmap below shows the trips recorded for each gender daily. From this heatmap, we observe that NYC CitiBikes are highly in demand by 8am, 5pm and 6pm daily among both male and female riders.

   ### User Trips by Gender by Weekday

   In this section, we have created a heatmap showing the trips recorded for various genders of NYC CitiBike customers and subscribers. Here, we observe that Thursdays are the most in-demand days for both male and female subscribers.

   ### Gender Breakdown

   The pie chart below shows the breakdown of the different genders that utilized the NYC CitiBike sharing service in August 2019. There were a total of 2,344,224 users and 1,530,272 users were male, 588,431 female and 225,521 user genders unknown.

   ### Peak Riding Hours

   The multiple horizontal bar graph below shows the number of rides recorded at different times of the day. We observe that peak riding for CitiBike users occurs between 5pm and 6pm in August 2019.

   ## Summary
  
   The results of our analysis shows that males were the primary users for CitiBikes in NYC for the month of August 2019. Peak usage occurred on Thursdays during the late hours of that day. Also, most users usually cycle between 5 and 10 minutes and most bikes are returned before 20 minutes of use.

   I suggest two analyses of start and end trips to complement this project, using maps for visualization. These analyses would be helpful as they could help the company organize logistics and resources to serve customers better.
