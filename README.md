**Analysis and Visualization of  Bike-Sharing Data with Tableau**

  ## Overview of Project
  A stakeholder would like to see an analysis of the New York CikiBike sharing program and leverage on the result of this analysis to convince investors that a similar bike-sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa will be successful. In this project, we will analyze data from New York CikiBike sharing data for the month of August 2019 and prepare visualizations that will be helpful for the stakeholder to make this business decision.  

   The sequence of analysis to be followed for this project is summarized below:

  1.	Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format using Python.
  2.	Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis using Tableau Public
  3.	Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation using Tableau Public
